# Please Note -  

- We were Supposed to submit a Hardhat Project to deploy a solidity Certificate contract with some additional functions and modifiers. 
- In yet another question we were supposed to submit a Server side a application using Web3.js.

- I combined both assignments and sumitted a Hardhat + API project that ddeploys the required Solidity smart contract and uses Web3 js for interaction.

- Vyper-Contract - Vyper-dapp
- Solidity-Certificate + Web3 Server API - edp-Dapp
- Sepolia Hardhat + Server API - edp-3-3
